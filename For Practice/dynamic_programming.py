# Given a list of weights and a list of costs, 
# find the optimal subset of things that 
# form the highest cumulative price bounded by the capacity of the knapsack.

# Sample Inputs:
# weights = [1, 2, 4, 6]
# prices = [4, 2, 4, 7]
# capacity = 7

# 1. What is the problem?
# find the maximum

# 2. What are the sub-problems?

# 3. What would the solution roughly look like?
